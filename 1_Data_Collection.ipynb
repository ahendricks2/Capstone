I use the 2015-16 season as a cut off because, while the league has changed significantly since then, teams had already adapted core features of modern basketball at that point: many power forwards were expected and able to shoot three point shots, for instance. \n",

I learned how to do this from the [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Ih934hADU) from Dataquest and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IELK56jIsEo) from Learn with Jabe, and while I wrote my own code for my specific purpose, I adapted my approach from those videos. First, I start with box score data because that is the data set that contains the target variable. After gathering the box score data, I collect additional player and team data to use as features in my model."
